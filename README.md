## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of DevOps principles with a Java application. It includes the complete lifecycle of software development, deployment, and monitoring, following industry best practices. The project utilizes tools and technologies for source control, continuous integration, containerization, orchestration, and monitoring.

## Features
- Modular Java application
- Continuous Integration with automated builds
- Continuous Deployment to a containerized environment
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven/Gradle
- **Version Control:** Git
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins/GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform/Ansible

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or later)
2. Maven or Gradle
3. Docker and Docker Compose
4. Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, AKS, EKS, or GKE)
5. Terraform/Ansible for infrastructure provisioning

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nisharg-04/Java-Project-With-DevOps.git
cd Java-Project-With-DevOps
```

### Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run Locally
To run the application locally:
```bash
java -jar target/your-application.jar
```

### Docker Setup
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t java-devops-project .
   ```
2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 java-devops-project
   ```

### Kubernetes Deployment
1. Apply the Kubernetes manifests:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
2. Access the application using the service endpoint.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows` or Jenkins pipeline scripts.

### CI Pipeline
- Automated build and test on every commit
- Static code analysis using tools like SonarQube

### CD Pipeline
- Docker image build and push to Docker Hub
- Deployment to Kubernetes cluster
